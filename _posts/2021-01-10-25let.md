My name is Yaroslav, I was born in St. Petersburg, and I graduated from a good school with a mathematical bias with three grades. In high school, I took a programming course and became interested in it. After school, in 2013 I went to SPbETU (LETI) for innovation management with grand: this is a specialty at the Faculty of Economics and Management, but for some reason they took in students with good Unified State Exam computer science score.

The specialty turned out to be very interesting and after passing the general basic subjects in the first years, I've returned to the scholarship. We were taught a lot of interesting studies on the verge of economics, management, mathematics, materials science and electrical engineering. The only subject that failed CAD simulating. I had to retake it in autumn. After studies, I was  familiar with the legal, negotiations, knew how to calculate projects payback, and also understood the technical aspects of project development. At the end of my studies, I began to like it so much that I was upset with the B mark for diploma.

In my last year of university, I met a girl who invited me to participate in the Code4Piter hackathon and we won it – programming skills from school helped us. Then we won the second "ArtMedia hack" separately, and then we found out about internship in the Sirius educational center in Sochi and went there for one month. During this month, we were inspired by the culture, worked hard and were offered to stay on a permanent job.

Over the next year, a lot of interesting things happened in Sochi. I took a job of laboratory assistant in the circuit engineering laboratory. I had to urgently upgrade my skills in circuit engineering, programming and pedagogy.
For a year of work, I've:
1. Launched a laboratory of circuit engineering, wrote, approved and conducted the first educational programs.
2. Conducted a thousand classes and lectures for the best students in the country, showing them why they need the Ohm's rule, Boolean algebra, and how to count the microcontroller legs.
3. Together with the students, I made a bunch of cool educational projects like a Skype controlled rover, self-made drone, robo-hand and a walking robot.

Along in my work, I got acquainted with neural networks through online courses and decided that data analysis is my vocation. In February, I tried to enroll in a master's program at Skoltech in Data Science. I passed motivation stage and mathematics test, but I was rejected due to the fact that my previous education did not correlate with what Skoltech needed at all. Then I persuaded the admissions committee to consider my candidacy for the faculty of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, entered and moved to Moscow.

The excitement of Skoltech teachers will allow you to believe that the mountains are knee-deep and everything is possible. The educational program at Skoltech is divided into blocks: business block, faculty block, and other courses. At the business block, we were told a lot about how to do projects correctly, how to find out user problems, how to solve them, and how to make money on it. In the faculty block we studied lot about the calculation of materials, numerical simulating and advanced manufacturing technologies. For example, we made composite specimens from different materials or printed them with metal with different parameters, and then broke it down on special machines and explained why the materials behave like this. My other courses include data science, the Internet of Things, and systems engineering.

Almost all courses involve project activities, the most significant projects for me are: launching a nano-satellite into the stratosphere to test solar panels in the absence of an atmosphere and building an autonomous micro-greenhouse that regulates the microclimate based on the growth rate of plants obtained using a camera. Later on, I received a "UMNIK" grand for this project and I  joined development together with the iFarm startup.

In the summer,  Sirius again invited me for a month on a project camp-shift as a project manager. During the month of the program, me and a team of schoolchildren made a service for citizens mood analytics based Natural Language Processing of their social networks. Quite an interesting experience: for a month to manage a team of June developers, make sure that we run in the right direction and meet the requirements of the customer. According to the vote of experts, our project came out on top in terms of points among all. I am very proud that my project scored more points than the project of one of my Skoltech teacher. The results were transmitted to Rosatom "Smart City". And Sirius published an article about us in Russian News Aggregator - TASS.

In my second year at Skoltech, friends of friends invited me to participate in a wardrobe automation project at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) as an electronics engineer - hardware developer. It was a small project that a few guys came up with. Previously, all my projects were just for studying or grew up to the MVP stage, and this was the experience of creating a real project with real deadlines and real users. We worked on the HSE campus at nights until 6 am, and a few hours later I was sitting on class at Skoltech. It seems that the project ended well only thanks to a mixture of Bravery and stupidity. I remember how at the very beginning the guys gave me microcontrollers with which I was not familiar and said that they had invented a new interface for communication between the boards, but it something does not work well and it is necessary to redo everything. But we sorted everything out, installed our wardrobe in school, fixed all the bugs, took into account all the abnormal user behavior, and since the fall of 2019, our wardrobe has been working successfully. We fired the cloakroom attendant and saved the HSE from queues.

Around the same time, I was invited to teach robotics to grades 5-6 at the private general education school President on Rublevka district. Once, after the head teacher visited my class, and called mi to the school principal – at that moment, my heart sank into my heels. But it turned out that they want to offer to go to them on a permanent basis. At that moment, I thought – what am I even interested in? And I realised that it wasn't money at all. It's much more important for me to do something meaningful, something that will help millions of people. And I definitely won't be able to do that while working at the school.


A huge part of the education at Skoltech is devoted to the thesis-it is written almost all the time of training. I suddenly chose the topic of mathematical simulating of polymerization of resins used in composite materials. The results of the study were published in 2 scientific articles indexed in SCOPUS and Google scholar. After 2 years of study, he completed a master's degree at Skoltech with a red diploma and a single B in continuum mechanics. In fact, there were more fours, but because I completed more courses than the program intended, I was able to simply cross the fours out of the diploma. In addition, I was separately congratulated as one of the most enterprising students of the graduation.

At the end of the second year, I won a grant to study at the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo on the MTS Moove program. This is very similar to the business track at Skoltech, only on a completely different level. More teachers, more people from the industry more practice. Here I was taught to think very differently, to reflect, to ask myself questions and to answer them. Gave a lot of knowledge about the proper project management. All the time of training, we did our project from scratch. It was very interesting to see how all the techniques given to us gradually improve project management and communication within the team, increasing team productivity. In six months, we found the problem, chose a segment, conducted 100 interviews, realised who are competitors, did better than they, and made a profit in money.

After completing my training at Skoltech and the Moscow School of Management, I took an internship at MTS, successfully completed it, and now I work as a PO in the Partnership Relations department. I will write more about this experience later
