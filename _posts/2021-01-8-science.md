All my scientific activities took place from 2017 to 2020 during my master's degree at Skoltech. I devoted this time to the study of composites, namely, the mathematical simulating of the resin polymerization process.

During the time of writing my dissertation, I published 3 articles. There I'm trying to detect end explain how technological additives affects on resin curing process with differential scanning callorimether (DSC).

One thar arteicles was published at the most popular high quality journal - Composite Materials, so I'm proud with this fact.

Articles are available at [Google Academy](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?hl=en&user=7QUp3gcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=title) and [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yaroslav-Nasonov). The full text of the dissertation is avaliabe to [download]({{site.url}}/download/Nasonov Master Thesis_v5.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The main task of the research is to refine the existing mathematical models describing the thermodynamics of Vinyl ester curing. Also I've paid an attention of the effect of technological additives on the polymerization process. Better understanding of the curing process leads to composites production optimization and the absence of defects.
